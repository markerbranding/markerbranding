description: Branding for an Architectural Firm
services: ["Estrategia", "Logo", "Identidad", "Sitio web"]
sector: Architectural Firm
basics: |
    Eje Central is an architectural firm composed of professionals and led by three partners, each an expert in the three central pillars of their ideology: good architecture, efficient construction, and financial sensibility. They specialize in designing residential developments, both vertical and horizontal, with an agile and dynamic approach.

    As a newly established firm, Eje Central lacked a commercial name, logo, or any visual elements to form part of their brand identity. Everything was created from the ground up, starting with a set of values defined through initial interactions with the vision of the founding partners.
issue: The name Eje Central (Central Axis) emerged from the integration of the three distinct perspectives that each partner brings to the business. The team includes a specialist in architecture, another in construction, and a third in finance. Together, they represent three unique yet integral facets—a central axis from which the concepts for each new housing project are developed.
solution: |
    The logo was designed as a graphic abstraction, combining simple geometric shapes to form an “E” and a “C,” symbolizing the firm’s name. This minimalist and clean design reflects the firm’s commitment to clarity and balance in both design and operations.

    The brand identity was further developed to be sober, modern, and minimalistic, aligning with the architectural style of the firm. This approach not only reinforces the professional and innovative ethos of Eje Central but also ensures a timeless and elegant visual presence that resonates with their clients and the architectural industry.
