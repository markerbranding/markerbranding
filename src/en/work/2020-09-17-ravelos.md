description: Rebranding for a Michoacan-Style Carnitas Restaurant
services: ["Logo", "Identidad Corporativa"]
sector: Restaurant
basics: Ravelo’s is a Michoacán-style carnitas restaurant located in Mérida, Yucatán. Founded in 2005, it has delighted the palates of its diners and loyal customers ever since.
issue: The previous logo featured an illustration of a cheerful little pig wearing a chef’s hat, reflecting the restaurant’s fun and lively personality. While these characteristics aligned well with the restaurant’s identity, the logo presented several challenges in terms of reproduction across various materials and formats. Due to its saturated design, it was difficult to apply consistently on staff uniforms, signage for branches, or delivery motorbike boxes. Additionally, the amount of text in the logo forced the restaurant to use it in sizes that were not flexible or functional. Lastly, some elements of the old logo were sourced from various free-use graphics, which lacked cohesion and originality.
solution: Given the brand’s strong positioning and history, we decided to retain the pig character but redesigned it with a unique style and a well-defined identity. The new design portrays the pig happily enjoying tacos at Ravelo’s. Its playful pose, lying on the ground, emulates someone laughing while also reflecting the feeling of being so full after a satisfying meal yet wishing to keep savoring every bite. Finally, we complemented the character with a cheerful, legible typeface that adds personality and weight, harmonizing perfectly with the bold lines of the icon.
