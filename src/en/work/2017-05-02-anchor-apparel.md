description: Corporate identity for a printed T-Shirt company
services: ["Logo", "Identidad Corporativa"]
sector:  Textile design
basics: Anchor Apparel is a company with over 25 years of experience, dedicated to manufacturing and exporting t-shirts, hats, sweaters, school and sports uniforms, among other products. The company’s value lies in its low production and distribution costs from Mexico to the United States, largely due to its strategic location compared to its closest competitor, China. Another key characteristic is its constant attention to detail and high-quality standards throughout the manufacturing process, resulting in a high level of customer satisfaction.
issue: Previously known as Anchor Export, Anchor Apparel wanted to relaunch its brand with a modern and casual image—fresh and renewed—to compete with other brands in the U.S. market. The original corporate identity had never been updated since the company’s inception.
solution: |
    As a starting point, the name was changed to Anchor Apparel to reinforce the concept of dressing people. A key requirement was that the logo had to reference an anchor; however, this element did not fit well with the initial brand concepts. As a result, we highlighted the company’s added value: ensuring customer satisfaction with high-quality products while always offering friendly and cordial service.

    Through an in-depth analysis and design process, we developed a graphic identity that retains the anchor element while incorporating a simple yet immediately recognizable feature in the new corporate signature: happiness.

    Finally, we created the graphic applications required by the client to support their sales process, along with a brand usage manual to guide any future applications.
