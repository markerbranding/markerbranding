description: Rebranding for an Industrial Hydraulic Solutions Company
services: ["Estrategia", "Logo", "Identidad", "Sitio Web"]
sector: Industrial Hydraulic Measurement
basics: Suhissa is a national leader in implementing flow measurement technologies, with 15 years of continuous service. The company specializes in consulting and designing hydraulic engineering projects, integrating products and services to deliver innovative solutions for managing national waters and industrial processes.
issue: |
    Despite being focused on providing technological solutions for the industrial sector at a national level, with a significant reach and a prestigious client base, Suhissa still received mistaken calls from individuals seeking bulk parts for home installations—services outside its scope. This confusion stemmed from the company’s general and ambiguous messaging, which failed to clearly define its industrial specialization. A restructuring of its communication, both in tone and visuals, was essential to accurately reflect its mission and expertise.
    
    At the start of the research process, the original logo: a figurative representation of a water droplet - was not initially identified as requiring change. However, as the strategy evolved, it became increasingly clear that the logo did not capture what made Suhissa unique. The company’s value lies not in the water itself but in the measurement of water through advanced technologies, including software, hardware, valves, and telemetric precision.
    
    The problem became even more apparent when the original logo was tested on hypothetical use cases, such as a water jug or a laundromat. In these contexts, the logo seemed appropriate, revealing how its design lacked specificity and focus on Suhissa’s actual offerings. The branding needed to pivot towards representing the core technological expertise that defines Suhissa.
solution: |
  The new branding draws on four core elements to create a logo and identity that more accurately represents Suhissa’s strengths: 1) Measurement systems (code and telemetry) – Highlighting the advanced technology behind water flow measurement. 2) The globe – Representing the broader context of water measurement on a global scale. 3) A smile – Symbolizing excellent service and customer satisfaction, a key strength uncovered during the research phase. 4) The water droplet – Retained as a secondary, supportive element to maintain a connection to Suhissa’s origins and industry. 
  
  These elements were combined to create a new logo that emphasizes Suhissa’s focus on technology, innovation, and precision. The design features clean, modern lines and a strong, industrial aesthetic that aligns with its role as a leader in hydraulic flow measurement.

  The rebranding provided Suhissa with a modern, technology-driven identity that clearly differentiates it from general water-related businesses and positions it as an authoritative figure in the industrial sector. The new logo and refined messaging help eliminate confusion, effectively communicating Suhissa’s expertise and specialization in hydraulic flow measurement technology. This updated identity strengthens its market presence and reinforces its reputation as a national leader in the field.
