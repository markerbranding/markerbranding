description: Corporate identity for a furniture factory
services: ["Logo", "Identidad Corporativa"]
sector: Integral kitchen factory
basics: Armarius is a factory specializing in integral kitchens, closets, and doors, established in Mérida, Yucatán, in 2013. It is a 100% Yucatecan company dedicated to the design, manufacturing, and installation of furniture and carpentry. The company began operations focusing on the residential private client market, achieving sustained growth throughout 2013 and 2014. In early 2015, its services expanded to include builders and housing developers. Today, Armarius is a supplier to several of the region’s leading developments.
issue: Armarius experienced significant growth thanks to its work with construction companies and real estate developments. However, it began to neglect sales to private clients. To refocus attention on this sector, the company needed a redesign of its logo to effectively reflect its new commercial approach, as well as an update to all its graphic and printed applications, the management and handling of its social media, and a complete redesign of its website.
solution: The project began by identifying the client’s specific needs. The first step was redesigning the logo, which, while simple and appropriate for the industry, lacked a distinctive element to strengthen its identity and make it memorable in the public’s perception. The process started with refining the letters, adding more stylization to the logo. Then, an icon was created using the letter “A,” which was also modified to represent the brand’s three main products - integral kitchens, closets, and doors. The tagline was adjusted to highlight these three products as well. The result was a new corporate signature that maintained the simplicity and elegance of the original version but with distinctive additions that made it stand out. Once the new logo was finalized, the next step was to create the most frequently used graphic applications for the company.
