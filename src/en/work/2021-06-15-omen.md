description: Corporate identity for an industrial design company
services: ["Logo", "Identidad Corporativa"]
sector:  Industrial design
basics: |
    Omen is an industrial design consulting agency based in Mérida. Its approach is directly inspired by its name: an omen is a phenomenon that foretells an event or change about to happen. Omen represents a way of seeing the world—an ongoing questioning of why things around us exist, how they function, and how they were conceived. The company pays close attention to the present context to design innovative products that provide solutions for the immediate future.
issue: Omen already had a name and logo, but its founder reached out to us to develop a proposal that would visually represent the concept behind the brand’s vision—a vision that aligns with both the company’s name and its user-centered design approach.
solution: |
    We began by defining the core concepts that shape Omen, a company specializing in designing products that adapt to users’ contexts to provide solutions, making life easier and more practical. We identified three key aspects: 1) The user for whom the product is designed. 2) The world in which the product must integrate. 3) The direction of design to ensure proper interaction between the user, the product, and its environment.

    For each aspect, we created a simple representative graphic: a circle for the world, an arrow for direction, and an avatar for the user. These elements were combined into a single abstract symbol with a modern and minimalist style. Finally, we developed a corporate identity that aligns seamlessly with the logo and Omen’s design philosophy.
