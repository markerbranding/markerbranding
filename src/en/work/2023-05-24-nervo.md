description: Branding for a Real Estate Company
services: ["Estrategia", "Logo", "Identidad", "Sitio Web", "Marketing"]
sector: Real Estate
basics: Nervo is a real estate company made up of a team of experts in the field, committed to each client to find the property that best suits their needs through understanding their requirements and conducting thorough market research.
issue: When Nervo approached us, they were a newly established company with no name or identity. The first challenge was to create a short and registrable name. To achieve this, we began by investigating the core values that make the company unique and special.
solution: |
    We started by analyzing the primary value the real estate agency offers its clients: the ability to connect those looking to purchase a home with the perfect property. This is achieved through their deep knowledge of the real estate market and a clear understanding of their clients’ needs. This concept was abstracted into an allegory of the human nerve, which is defined as a conductor structure that sends and receives messages between the body and the brain. Similarly, the agency acts as a nerve by receiving client information and processing it to deliver the ideal property.

    The word nerve comes from the etymological root Nervorum, which was simplified to Nervo. This concept of connection was then used as inspiration for the design of their logo and corporate identity, resulting in a cohesive and meaningful brand that reflects the company’s essence and mission.
