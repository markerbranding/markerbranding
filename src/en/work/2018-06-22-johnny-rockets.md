sector:  Restaurant chain
basics: Johnny Rockets is a restaurant chain that began in 1986 in Los Angeles, California. Seven years later, it opened its first restaurant in Mexico and has experienced continuous growth, allowing it to establish more than 300 locations worldwide.
issue: The Galerías Mérida branch required a vehicle wrap design, maintaining the graphic style inspired by the 1950s and 1960s, for which the franchise is known.
solution: The project began with photographing the vehicles and measuring the work areas. A digital template was then created based on these measurements to ensure full coverage of all external surfaces of the vans. With the layout defined, the next step was designing proposals that incorporated graphic elements aligned with the brand’s personality, along with various photographic materials. The final result is a striking design that stays true to Johnny Rockets’ classic style while serving the added function of informing and advertising the restaurant to passersby.
