We use **standardized** programming languages and modern frameworks. Our work focuses on **security and optimization**, which is why we rely on technologies that generate static sites using dynamic tools.
Some of the frameworks we use most frequently include Next.js, Gatsby (React-based), Astro and Eleventy. However, we prefer to let the specific needs and focus of each project determine the choice of technology.
This approach ensures that every project is built using the most suitable tools for its unique requirements.
