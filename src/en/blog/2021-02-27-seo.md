SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is one of the most profitable and effective traffic sources for your business on the internet. It’s the optimization process that ensures your website appears among the top search results on Google and other search engines. In this article, you’ll learn why SEO should be a priority for your business.

## How SEO used to work

A few years ago, SEO was easily manipulated within search engines. It was enough to repeat the keywords you wanted to rank for multiple times on your website, and you’d quickly appear in search results. However, since the early 2010s, Google has continuously updated its algorithm to eliminate these outdated practices, which are now penalized. Only websites with relevant, well-structured, and high-quality content for users can achieve better rankings in search engines today.

## The Benefits of SEO and Why It Should Be a Priority for Your Business

There are many direct and indirect benefits of having good SEO for your website. Here are the four key ways it can help grow your brand:

1. Builds Credibility and Trust: SEO can enhance the validity and trustworthiness of your business. Search engines serve as the perfect showcase for potential customers to discover you—even if they don’t yet know your brand name. People tend to believe that the top results in a search belong to the best companies in their industry. This perception adds credibility and professionalism to your business.

2. Increases Website Traffic: SEO is the perfect way to generate a steady and automated flow of visitors to your website without paying for cost-per-click campaigns. While paid ads can give you immediate visibility at the top of search results, they can be expensive, especially for competitive keywords. Additionally, once your budget runs out, your ads disappear. SEO, on the other hand, offers long-term traffic without constant spending.

3.  Generates Leads and Boosts Sales: SEO can increase the number of potential clients and online sales. For this to happen, your website must be well-designed and optimized to achieve that goal. It’s essential to make contact methods straightforward and accessible to facilitate purchases, service inquiries, or showcasing your work in a digital portfolio.

4. Improves Customer Service: SEO can also enhance customer service. By implementing FAQ sections on your site, you can answer common questions from your audience without the need for additional budgets to create internal support teams. This not only saves costs but also improves the user experience for your visitors.

## A Success Story Through Effective SEO

Armarius is a kitchen and closet manufacturing company based in Mérida, Yucatán. For months, they maintained a fixed budget for paid campaigns on Facebook and Instagram. While these campaigns positively contributed to brand positioning, they didn’t directly translate into sales. A significant percentage of people who initially expressed interest failed to follow through after being contacted by the sales team.

After redesigning their website and improving their SEO, Armarius began ranking in first and second place for searches like “kitchen cabinets in Mérida” and “closets in Mérida.” This resulted in an average of one quote request per day without needing to spend on additional campaigns. These inquiries came from people actively seeking to meet a specific need, unlike the more variable and irregular results seen on social media.

Today, Armarius no longer pays for social media campaigns to generate sales. Instead, their clients arrive automatically through their website. This is a clear example of why SEO and a well-designed website aligned with your commercial goals should be a top priority for your business.
